/*
 A design pattern is a reusable solution
 to a common problem that occurs within a specific 
 context in software design

 It is like a rough blue print which has 
 proven to solve recurring issue while coding


 Advantages of design pattern
 1. standardized solution
 2. imporoved readability and maintenance
 3. faster development with best practices
 4. easier communcication among developers


 Types of design pattern

 1. creational : how objects are created               eg: singleton, factory, builder
 2. structural : how classes/objects are composed      eg: adapter, decorator, proxy
 3. behavioral : how objects communictes and interact  observer, startegy, command


 creational pattern
 1. focus on object creation
 2. helps control how and when objects are instantiated

 eg
 factory: create objects based on input type
 singleton: only one instance of a class
 builder: step-by-step object creation


 structural pattern
 focus on object composition
 help make flexible and scalable code architecture

 eg
 adapter: makes incompatible interfaces compatible
 decorator: add new behaviour to existing object dynamically
 proxy: control access to an object

 behaviour pattern
 focus on communication between objects
 help manage algorithms, relationships, and reponsibilities

 eg:
 observer: one=to-many notification
 strategy: swap the algorithms at runtime
 command: encapsulate a request as an object

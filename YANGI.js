/*
  YANGI - you aren't gonna need it
  Don't implement something until it is necessary

  Do not add features, logic or code "just in case" you might need them later.

  Advantages
  1. keeps code simple and focused
  2. reduces unnecessary complexity
  3. saves developement time
  4. makes debugging and testing easier
  5. avoids wasting effort on unused features
